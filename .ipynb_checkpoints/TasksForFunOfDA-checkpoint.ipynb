    "Lists and dictionaries have some things in common. Both are data structures containing one or more data points. You can change and alter both during the execution of a program, otherwise known as being mutable. You can nest both inside a list or a dictionary. Both can be, but do not have to be, homogeneous. Meaning that you can have numbers, strings and Booleans in the same list or dictionary. [1]\n",

Simply put this means that when you search for `list[0]` it will look up the first element of the list but when you search `dict[0]` it will search for the key value 0 and give you the corresponding value. And that each element in a list has a value but in a dictionary each element has a key and a value.[2]"
