# FunOfDA-TasksAssessment

This is my submission for Fundamentals of Data Analysis due by the 18th of December. Four tasks given periodically over the semester to be completed in the same Jupyter notebook.

Task 1: In this task I explain the different between lists and dictionaries and how elements are accessed differently. I explain each step to converting a list to a dictionary where each unique value is the key the value is the amount of times it is present in the list. I then create a function to deal with case sensitivity.
